\title{GET a url.}
\usage{
GET(url = NULL, config = list(), ..., handle = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{the url of the page to retrieve}

\item{config}{Additional configuration settings such as http
authentication (\code{\link{authenticate}}), additional headers
(\code{\link{add_headers}}), cookies (\code{\link{set_cookies}}) etc.
See \code{\link{config}} for full details and list of helpers.}

\item{...}{Further named parameters, such as \code{query}, \code{path}, etc,
passed on to \code{\link{modify_url}}. Unnamed parameters will be combined
with \code{\link{config}}.}

\item{handle}{The handle to use with this request. If not
  supplied, will be retrieved and reused from the \code{\link{handle_pool}}
  based on the scheme, hostname and port of the url. By default \pkg{httr}
  requests to the same scheme/host/port combo. This substantially reduces
  connection time, and ensures that cookies are maintained over multiple
  requests to the same host. See \code{\link{handle_pool}} for more
  details.}

\section{RFC2616}{

The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an
entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a
data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as
the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless
that text happens to be the output of the process.

The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the
request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since,
If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET method
requests that the entity be transferred only under the circumstances
described by the conditional header field(s). The conditional GET method is
intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing cached entities to
be refreshed without requiring multiple requests or transferring data
already held by the client.

The semantics of the GET method change to a "partial GET" if the request
message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests that only
part of the entity be transferred, as described in \url{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35}
The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by
allowing partially-retrieved entities to be completed without transferring
data already held by the client.

GET("http://google.com/")
GET("http://google.com/", path = "search")
GET("http://google.com/", path = "search", query = list(q = "ham"))

# See what GET is doing with httpbin.org
url <- "http://httpbin.org/get"
GET(url)
GET(url, add_headers(a = 1, b = 2))
GET(url, set_cookies(a = 1, b = 2))
GET(url, add_headers(a = 1, b = 2), set_cookies(a = 1, b = 2))
GET(url, authenticate("username", "password"))
GET(url, verbose())

# You might want to manually specify the handle so you can have multiple
# independent logins to the same website.
google <- handle("http://google.com")
GET(handle = google, path = "/")
GET(handle = google, path = "search")
