\usage{
  GET(url = NULL, config = list(), ..., handle = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{url}{the url of the page to retrieve}

  \item{...}{Further parameters, such as \code{query},
  \code{path}, etc, passed on to \code{\link{modify_url}}.
  These parameters must be named.}

  \item{config}{Additional configuration settings such as
  http authentication (\code{\link{authenticate}}),
  additional headers (\code{\link{add_headers}}), cookies
  (\code{\link{set_cookies}}) etc.  See
  \code{\link{config}} for full details and list of
  helpers.}

  \item{handle}{The handle to use with this request. If not
  supplied, will be retrieved and reused from the
  \code{\link{handle_pool}} based on the scheme, hostname
  and port of the url. By default \pkg{httr} requests to
  the same scheme/host/port combo. This substantially
  reduces connection time, and ensures that cookies are
  maintained over multiple requests to the same host. See
  \code{\link{handle_pool}} for more details.}

\description{
  GET a url.
}
\section{RFC2616}{
  The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in
  the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI.
  If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it
  is the produced data which shall be returned as the
  entity in the response and not the source text of the
  process, unless that text happens to be the output of the
  process.

  The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional
  GET" if the request message includes an
  If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match,
  If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional
  GET method requests that the entity be transferred only
  under the circumstances described by the conditional
  header field(s). The conditional GET method is intended
  to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing cached
  entities to be refreshed without requiring multiple
  requests or transferring data already held by the client.

  The semantics of the GET method change to a "partial GET"
  if the request message includes a Range header field. A
  partial GET requests that only part of the entity be
  transferred, as described in
  \url{http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35}
  The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary
  network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to
  be completed without transferring data already held by
  the client.

\examples{
GET("http://google.com/")
GET("http://google.com/", path = "search")
GET("http://google.com/", path = "search", query = c(q = "ham"))

# See what GET is doing with request.bin
b <- new_bin()
GET(b)
GET(b, add_headers(a = 1, b = 2))
GET(b, set_cookies(a = 1, b = 2))
GET(b, authenticate("username", "password"))
GET(b, verbose())

# You might want to manually specify the handle so you can have multiple
# independent logins to the same website.
google <- handle("http://google.com")
GET(handle = google, path = "/")
GET(handle = google, path = "search")
