\title{Generate a classed http condition.}
\usage{
http_condition(x, type, message = NULL, call = sys.call(-1))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a response, or numeric http code (or other object with
\code{status_code} method)}

\item{type}{type of condition to generate. Must be one of error,
warning or message.}

\item{message}{The text of the message. If \code{NULL}, the default,
will use \code{\link{http_status}} to generate the message.}

\item{call}{The call stored in the condition object.}
}
\value{
An S3 object that inherits from (e.g.) condition, \code{type},
  http_error, http_400 and http_404.
}
\description{
This function generate S3 condition objects which are passed to
\code{\link{stop}} or \code{\link{warning}} to generate classes warnings
and error. These can be used in conjunction with \code{\link{tryCatch}}
to respond differently to different type of failure.
}
\examples{
# You can use tryCatch to take different actions based on the type
# of error. Note that tryCatch will call the first handler that
# matches any classes of the condition, not the best matching, so
# always list handlers from most specific to least specific
f <- function(url) {
  tryCatch(stop_for_status(GET(url)),
    http_404 = function(c) "That url doesn't exist",
    http_403 = function(c) "You need to authenticate!",
    http_400 = function(c) "You made a mistake!",
    http_500 = function(c) "The server screwed up"
  )
}
