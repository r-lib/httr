httr 0.2
----------

* OAuth now uses custom escaping function which is guaranteed to work on all
  platforms (Fixes #21)

* When concatenating configs, concatenate all the headers. (Fixes #19)

* export `hmac_sha1` since so many authentication protocols need this

* `content` will automatically guess what type of output (parsed, text or raw)
  based on the content-type header. It also automatically converts text
  content to UTF-8 (using the charset in the media type) and can guess at mime
  type from extension if server doesn't supply one. Media type and encoding
  can be overridden with the `type` and `encoding` arguments respectively.

* response objects automatically print content type to aid debugging.

* `text_content` has become `context(, "text")` and `parsed_content`
  `content(, "parsed")`. The previous calls are deprecated and will be removed
  in a future version.

* In `oauth_listener`, use existing httpd port if help server has already been
  started. This allows the ouath authentication dance to work if you're in
  RStudio. (Fixes #15).

* add several functions related to checking the status of an http request.
  Those are : `status`, `url_ok` and `url_success` as well as
  `stop_for_status` and `warn_for_status`.

* `build_url`: correctly add params back into full url.
