[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/httr)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=httr)

The aim of httr is to provide a wrapper for the [curl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl) package, customised to the demands of modern web APIs.

Key features:

* Functions for the most important http verbs: `GET()`, `HEAD()`, `PATCH()`, 
  `PUT()`, `DELETE()` and `POST()`.

* Automatic connection sharing across requests to the same website (by
  default, curl handles are managed automatically), cookies are maintained
  across requests, and a up-to-date root-level SSL certificate store is used.

* Requests return a standard reponse object that captures the http status line,
  headers and body, along with other useful information.

  * Response content is available with `content()` as a raw vector (`as =
    "raw"`), a character vector (`as = "text"`), or parsed into an R object
    (`as = "parsed"`), currently for html, xml, json, png and jpeg.

  * You can convert http errors into R errors with `stop_for_status()`.

* Config functions make it easier to modify the request in common ways:
  `set_cookies()`, `add_headers()`, `authenticate()`, `use_proxy()`, 
  `verbose()`, `timeout()`, `content_type()`, `accept()`, `progress()`.

* Support for OAuth 1.0 and 2.0 with `oauth1.0_token()` and `oauth2.0_token()`.
  The demo directory has eight OAuth demos: four for 1.0 (twitter, vimeo,
  withings and yahoo) and four for 2.0 (facebook, github, google, linkedin). 
  OAuth credentials are automatically cached within a project. 

`httr` wouldn't be possible without the hard work of the authors of [curl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl) and [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/). Thanks! `httr` is inspired by http libraries in other languages, such as [Resty](http://beders.github.com/Resty/Resty/Examples.html), [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) and [httparty](http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/tree/master).
